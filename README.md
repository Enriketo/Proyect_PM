Besides the need to improve our skills in frontend, backend, and data science and get experience working as a team and to improve our communication skills; nowadays is indispensable to have an online system of reservations of any kind of service your company is offering to everyone. Therefore, we are going to make a **reservation system of appointments with doctors and specialists**. There you can sign in and log in with your social media, you can select the date and have some information about the doctor or the specialist you are interested in and, obviously, you can make a reservation.

This project is important because in Colombia and other countries if you want an appointment with a specialist you must do it through one call to the specialist´ secretary and wait to get a positive answer of his/her agenda. Thus, we are trying to reach a bet application where we can portray one solution to this problem. 

The process of execution of the project is summarized in a couple of steps.
- First, to investigate some reference sites of booking.
- Second, to define the design of the website and the functionality. 
- And finally, to develop the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and, additionally, some other technologies like Python :snake: , node.js, etc. 

After all the process detailed previously, we need to get an assessment from our coach and iterate to get a good beta app or improve it a little more.

# Problem Statement - Alejandro Palacios Arévalo :smile:

Due to current conditions not only in Colombia but worldwide, the health sector in general has taken a course which will expose it to difficult decision conditions where, on the one hand, it must deal with the problem of overcrowding and care timely not only for patients with COVID-19, but also in the other specialties that people require such as, to name a few, dentistry, surgical operations, treatments and the entire catalog of diseases, chronic conditions, ailments and even accidents that are present in all levels and socio-economic strata of a population, city or country, and on the other hand, reliability of public and health care programmed according to the needs of patients such as the execution and care of traditional medical appointments.


In that order of ideas and in order to abide by the order of social distancing, quarantine at home and self-care of people, it is important to support the health sector with technological tools that allow patients and users in general with the ability to pay and technological means, they can book and take medical appointments remotely, that is, that medical care is carried out through a platform that promotes social distancing and prevents patients from traveling on unnecessary occasions to take a medical appointment.

The entire process would be carried out on the platform, starting with the registration of the users, going through the appointment reservation according to the required specialty, later the appointment payment, and then through reminders to the email and telephone line schedule the appointment and in the next few days make the respective reminders to avoid losses or reassignments of attention.

Finally, the appointment is taken directly from the platform via the web with all the computer security protocols that are required in the time that the specialist, according to the analyzes, queries and history, considers with a maximum of 30 minutes, to achieve the best possible care and move on to reassignment of a new web medical appointment.

Through this solution, we intend to attack the serious problem of uncrowded crowds in health entities head-on so that together we cut the scope of COVID-19 and avoid the spread of the virus intelligently and with tools available to the majority of citizens and inhabitants of the country.
